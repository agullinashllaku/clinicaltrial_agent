NCT06130982,Effects of Different Health Qigong Routines on CS Among Chinese College Students,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06130982,"Health Qigong, originated from Chinese traditional guidance techniques, is known as China's ""six major medical techniques"" together with ""stone breaking"", ""acupuncture and moxibustion"", ""massage"", ""medicine"" and ""walking on stilts"" of traditional Chinese medicine, and has dual functions of sports and medicine. It mainly takes its own physical activities, breathing, and psychological regulation as its main form, improving the overall functional state of the human body through both internal and external cultivation, and improving the training practice method system of its own life movement. At present, it has 9 popular routines around the world, such as the famous Yi Jin Jing, Wu Qin Xi, Ba Duan Jin, and Liu Zi Jue. In the exercise therapy of cervical spondylosis, the exercise form of Health Qigong is similar to Tai Chi, and has greater advantages compared to other sports(Tai Chi, McKinsey, Cervical Spine Exercise, Resistance Exercise, etc). Previous studies have confirmed that Health Qigong·Yijinjing combined with acupuncture and moxibustion, massage and other intervention therapies can repair cervical muscle fibers, relieve pain and improve cervical function. Health Qigong·Wuqinxi combined with other intervention therapies can positively promote the pain index, cervical mobility, and other factors in middle-aged and elderly patients with cervical spondylosis.Health Qigong·Baduanjin combined with other intervention therapies can enhance the stability of the cervical spine and not only help alleviate anxiety, depression, and other adverse psychological states in patients with cervical spondylosis, It can also reduce the degree of cervical mobility limitation, thereby reducing patient pain, alleviating clinical symptoms, improving clinical intervention effectiveness, and reducing recurrence rate. However, most studies have combined exercise therapy with physical therapy, medication therapy, and other interventions therapies, especially the study of using Health Qigong as an independent exercise therapy to intervene in cervical spondylosis is even rarer. Therefore, this study selected Health Qigong·Yijinjing, Health Qigong·Wuqinxi, and Health Qigong·Baduanjin as independent exercise intervention projects to conduct intervention research on cervical spondylosis among college students, exploring the effects of these three Health Qigong routines on pain, cervical curvature, and cervical joint disorders of Chinese college students with cervical spondylosis.",Neck Pain|Neck Disorder|Cervical Spondylosis,BEHAVIORAL: Health Qigong·Yijinjing|BEHAVIORAL: Health Qigong·Wuqinxi|BEHAVIORAL: Health Qigong·Baduanjin|BEHAVIORAL: Walking,"Effect of neck dysfunction among college students, Test by neck disability index (NDI) questionnaire , a total of 10 items were tested, including two parts: neck pain and related symptoms (intensity of pain, headache, concentration and sleep), and daily life activity ability (personal care, lifting heavy objects, reading, work, driving, and entertainment). The minimum score for each item is 0, and the maximum score is 5. The higher the score, the greater the degree of dysfunction. It can evaluate the cervical spine function impairment index, and when the result shows 0-20%, it indicates mild dysfunction; 21%-40%: indicates moderate dysfunction; 41%-60%: indicates severe functional impairment; 61% -80%: indicates extremely severe functional impairment; 81%-100%: indicates complete functional impairment or detailed examination of the subject for exaggerated symptoms., Pretest: Before experiment; Mid-test: 8 weeks end; Post-test: 12 weeks end.|Effect of neck pain among college students, Test by short-form of McGill pain questionnaire(SF-MPQ) ,which is derived from the McGill pain questionnaire and is used to measure the intensity and nature of pain currently experienced by participants.
